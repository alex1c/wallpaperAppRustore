# Roadmap — Calculator Platform

Phases are sequential; scope within each phase should not leak into earlier work.

## Phase 0 — Product & architecture ✅

- AGENTS.md, PRODUCT_STRATEGY, ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS, ROADMAP
- ADR log for major choices

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✅

- Expo + Router + TypeScript + dev build readiness
- i18n, units, theme, service abstractions
- Placeholder wallpaper domain + minimal UI
- Jest, ESLint, typecheck scripts

## Phase 1.5 — Android dev environment (current)

- Git baseline
- JDK 17 + ANDROID_HOME session setup
- Reproducible `expo prebuild --clean`
- Gradle `assembleDebug` verification
- Emulator/device optional

## Phase 2 — Wallpaper calculation engine

- Full mathematical model (quick + precise foundations)
- Pattern repeat, waste rules, openings (spec-driven)
- Exhaustive unit tests vs reference scenarios

## Phase 3 — Wallpaper MVP UX

- Quick calculation flow polished for RuStore
- Result screen, input validation UX, error states

## Phase 4 — Precise calculation

- Per-wall mode, rapport, half-drop, cut visualization
- Doors/windows, roll cut planning
- “Already have N rolls — enough?” mode

## Phase 5 — Ads & analytics

- Yandex Mobile Ads + mediation (RSЯ, VK Ads)
- AppMetrica production integration
- Ad frequency caps, rewarded flows
- Wire `ad_impression`, revenue-related events

## Phase 6 — Product quality

- Persistent settings & last calculation
- Accessibility audit, edge cases, performance
- Privacy policy content, data handling

## Phase 7 — RuStore release

- Signing, AAB, store listing, screenshots
- Moderation fixes, production verification

## Phase 8 — Measurement

- Retention, ad metrics, revenue/install analysis
- Decide scale / pivot / iterate

## Phase 9 — Platform extraction

**Gate:** positive or learnable RPI from Wallpaper Calculator

- Extract reusable template/core
- Second niche app (e.g. Tile Calculator)
- Optional shared package — not before data

---

**Current focus:** complete Phase 1.5 Android environment, then start Phase 2.
